    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Polybius: The Killer Arcade Game</h1>

    <img src="Polybius.png" alt="Polybius arcade machine illustration">
    <p>
        Have you ever picked up a game, only to lose track of time—like the machine itself was pulling you in? 
        Now imagine if that wasn’t by accident, but by design. 
        That’s the story at the heart of <strong>Polybius</strong>, one of the most enduring and unsettling gaming urban legends.
    </p>

    <h2>The Legend</h2>
    <p>
        In the early 1980s, a strange new arcade machine appeared in the Pacific Northwest. The game—called Polybius, supposedly made by a mysterious company named Sinneslöchen—looked advanced for its time, a vortex shooter reminiscent of Tempest.
        Kids lined up to play. They became obsessed. Some grew aggressive, depressed, or disoriented. A few suffered seizures. Rumors even spoke of self-harm.
        The cabinets disappeared as quickly as they arrived. In some versions of the tale, men in black were seen collecting data from the machines before they vanished.
    </p>

    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1990s:</strong> The first written account appeared on Coinop.org, a website archiving arcade games.</li>
        <li><strong>2003:</strong> GamePro magazine published “Secrets and Lies,” the first mainstream mention.</li>
        <li>From there, the story spread—into articles, videos, podcasts, even books and TV shows.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cultural Context</h2>
    <p>Urban legends often mirror their times:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the <strong>1980s</strong>, arcades boomed. Parents and politicians worried about kids “zoning out” for hours, about games causing violence or health problems. Cases of kids fainting from marathon sessions and epileptic seizures fueled the paranoia.</li>
        <li>Police raids on arcades for illegal gambling added a layer of secrecy and fear.</li>
        <li>Strange, visually intense games like Tempest or Cube Quest may have inspired the myth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        By the late <strong>1990s/2000s</strong>, the internet allowed people to share hazy memories. Each retelling added new details, cementing Polybius as a digital ghost story.
    </p>

    <h2>Where Truth Ends</h2>
    <p>No evidence supports Polybius’s existence. But the story endures because it touches on something real:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The addictive pull of games and screens.</li>
        <li>The fear of psychological manipulation.</li>
        <li>The idea of technology used as a weapon of control.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Like all good legends, Polybius blends truth, paranoia, and imagination until it feels almost believable.</p>

    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <p>
        Today, Polybius is referenced in documentaries, YouTube rabbit holes, creepypastas, and even modern indie games. 
        It has become less about whether the game was real and more about what it represents:
    </p>
    <p><strong>The fear that entertainment might not just consume our time, but reshape our minds.</strong></p>
